## TrackTime ##

Tracktime is a dual purpose application centered around tracking of current activities and management of future tasks within your projects.

You may use the application solely for tracking where you spend your time throughout the day such as a consultant may need to do, or equally as often, a normal employee working for big business.

You may also use the application to manage your day to day activities and what you may have upcoming in various projects. Part of this "future view" are loosely based on David Allen's Getting Things Done.

Just as the project itself supports two main functions, the usage of the application is also two sided. Support for command line operation as well as a build in web server allows for a combined approach in using the application.
